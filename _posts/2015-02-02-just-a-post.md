They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.[/caption]

The <b>Bee Gees</b> were a pop music group formed in 1958. Their line-up consisted of brothers <a title="Barry Gibb" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Gibb">Barry</a>, <a title="Robin Gibb" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Gibb">Robin</a> and <a title="Maurice Gibb" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Gibb">Maurice Gibb</a>. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success; as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's <a title="Rhythm and blues" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues">R&amp;B</a> <a title="Falsetto" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsetto">falsetto</a> became their signature sound during the late 1970s and 1980s. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.</span>
